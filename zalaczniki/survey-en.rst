Space exploration and industry
==============================

What should be our next target?
-------------------------------
- We should not explore deeper space yet, we have so much to do on Earth and on Low Earth Orbit
- Moon base - Moon outpost should be our priority
- Moon orbit and surface - can be a platform for future Mars missions, with occasional visits to surface
- Mars surface - to boldly go where no man has gone before!
- Mars colony - to settle on Mars
- Venus clouds - there is a possibility to find life in Venusian clouds
- Asteroids - for mining minerals and learning how to prevent collision with Earth
- I don't know / I don't have an opinion / Prefer not to disclose my opinion
